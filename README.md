## Hello
You likely have a technical interview with us in the near future. We're excited. Since the interview will be remote, we want to give you the greatest opportunity to do your best.

## What To Expect
The interview will happen over [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). One portion of the interview includes a coding exercise. We find that doing this hands-to-keyboard is more comfortable than on a whiteboard, so you will actually get to write code in the development environment of your choice!

## What You Need
* The ability **to share your screen** over Zoom so we can observe while you code.
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account so we can give you access to clone our coding exercise repository.
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) or a git [client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) so you can clone our coding exercise repository.
  * appropriate configuration of `git` or your git client to clone our private repository via [https](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-https-urls) or [ssh](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-ssh-urls).
* A development environment [ready](./python-smoketest) to do the exercise.
